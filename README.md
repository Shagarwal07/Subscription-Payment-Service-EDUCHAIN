Subscription Payment Service
Project Description
The Subscription Payment Service is a smart contract-based solution designed to manage subscription payments using Ethereum. Users can subscribe to services by paying a defined amount of Ether, granting them access for a fixed period. The system ensures automation, transparency, and decentralization in managing recurring payments.

Project Vision
To create a seamless and trustless subscription management system using blockchain technology that benefits both service providers and subscribers. By eliminating intermediaries, this system aims to reduce transaction fees, increase transparency, and foster a decentralized economy for digital services.
